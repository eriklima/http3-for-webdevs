slow-start-original.svg was adapted from https://hpbn.co/assets/diagrams/f57e23a8df0dbb1c90d75e02c4abd7bb.svg
That image (in my opinion somewhat incorrectly) calls slow start "congestion control",
which is what I changed.

Additionally, to fit within this particular article, I also changed the y-axis label from "congestion window size" to "packet send rate".

In related news: editing SVGs using online editors was a most terrible experience. Then trying to edit them with offline tools was even worse.
